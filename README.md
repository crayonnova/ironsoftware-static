# Project Description

This project is a static webpage developed as part of a job interview code test. The main goal was to implement the webpage design provided in Figma while focusing on website performance. The project was completed in a total of 8 hours.

## Technologies Used

- **Bootstrap 5**: The main framework used for the design and layout of the webpage.
- **Pure CSS**: Additional styling was applied using custom CSS to match the given design.
- **SVG Images**: Compressed SVG files were used for images to reduce file size and ensure pixel-perfect vector graphics.
- **Accessibility**: Several accessibility features were implemented to enhance the user experience, including:
  - *Skip Navigation*: Users can easily navigate to the main content by pressing the tab key.
  - *Alt Attributes*: All images have alt attributes to provide alternative text for screen readers.
- **Performance Optimization**: The project focused on web performance using Chrome Lighthouse tool. Measures taken include:
  - Semantic HTML: Ensuring proper and meaningful markup for better website structure.
  - Open Graph Tags: Added open graph tags to improve cross-link sharing on social media platforms.
  - Gotham Web Fonts: Optimized web fonts were used to ensure fast loading times.
  - Responsive Design: The webpage is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes using Bootstrap's responsive classes.

## Usage

To use the webpage, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The webpage will automatically adapt to your device's screen size, providing an optimal viewing experience.

Please note that this project is a static webpage and does not require any server-side setup or additional dependencies.

## Performance

The webpage has been optimized for performance, ensuring fast loading times and a smooth user experience. The use of compressed SVG files, minimal custom styles, semantic HTML, and optimized web fonts contribute to the overall performance of the webpage.
